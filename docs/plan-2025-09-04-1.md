## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Project Structure (Priority: High)
- [ ] Create `docs/` directory
- [ ] Create `docs/README-details.md` with comprehensive project documentation
- [ ] Create `CHANGELOG.md` based on existing README changelog
- [ ] Create `specs/` directory for specifications

### Phase 2: Testing Structure (Priority: High)
- [ ] Create `tests/unit/` subdirectory
- [ ] Create `tests/integration/` subdirectory
- [ ] Create `tests/e2e/` subdirectory
- [ ] Move existing test files to appropriate subdirectories
- [ ] Update `pyproject.toml` pytest configuration for new structure

### Phase 3: Code Quality Tools (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Replace Black with ruff configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Remove Black configuration
- [ ] Add ruff configuration for formatting and linting
- [ ] Update CI/pre-commit hooks to use ruff
- [ ] Run ruff on entire codebase and fix issues

### Phase 4: Python Standards Cleanup (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Review and remove remaining `Union` imports
- [ ] Ensure consistent use of `|` for all union types
- [ ] Verify type annotation completeness

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure Changes
```
splurge-tools/
├── docs/                    # NEW: Documentation directory
│   ├── README-details.md   # NEW: Detailed project docs
│   └── plan-2025-09-04-1.md # NEW: This plan
├── specs/                  # NEW: Specifications directory

├── CHANGELOG.md           # NEW: Changelog file
└── [existing structure]
```

### Ruff Configuration
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
target-version = "py310"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "W", "C90", "I", "N", "UP", "YTT", "S", "BLE", "FBT", "B", "A", "COM", "C4", "DTZ", "T10", "DJ", "EM", "EXE", "FA", "ISC", "ICN", "G", "INP", "PIE", "T20", "PYI", "PT", "Q", "RSE", "RET", "SLF", "SLOT", "SIM", "TID", "TCH", "INT", "ARG", "PTH", "ERA", "PD", "PGH", "PL", "TRY", "FLY", "NPY", "AIR", "PERF", "FURB", "LOG", "RUF"]

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"
indent-style = "space"
line-ending = "auto"
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- Ruff migration could introduce formatting conflicts
- Test reorganization might break existing test discovery

### Medium Risk Items
- Directory restructuring requires coordination across all files
- Documentation creation requires comprehensive knowledge of all features

### Low Risk Items
- Python standards cleanup is incremental
- Adding missing directories is straightforward

## Testing Strategy

### Compliance Testing
- [ ] Verify all cursor rules are addressed
- [ ] Validate ruff configuration works correctly
- [ ] Ensure test discovery works with new structure

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite after each phase
- [ ] Validate examples still work correctly
- [ ] Check build process remains functional

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 100% compliance with cursor rules checklist
- [ ] All phases completed successfully
- [ ] No functionality regressions
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes all checks
