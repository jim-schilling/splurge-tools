## Guidelines

### Document Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case for file names: `data-validation-spec.md`
- Include version numbers when applicable: `api-spec-v1.0.md`
- Use descriptive names that indicate content

### Document Structure
Each specification document should include:
1. **Overview**: Purpose and scope
2. **Requirements**: What needs to be implemented
3. **Design**: How it will be implemented
4. **Examples**: Usage examples
5. **Testing**: How to validate the implementation

### Version Control
- All specifications are version controlled
- Major changes require review and approval
- Keep change history in document headers

## Contributing
